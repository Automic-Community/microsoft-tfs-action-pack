## Getting Started:


###### Description
 
 Microsoft Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps Server (formerly called "Team Foundation Server" or "TFS") provide source code management (either via Team Foundation Version Control or Git), reporting, requirements management, project management, automated builds, lab management, testing and release management capabilities.

 They cover the entire Application Lifecycle Management. They can be used as a back end to numerous integrated development environments but are designed to provide the most benefit by serving as the back end to Microsoft Visual Studio or Eclipse.

 Automate builds, lab management, testing and release management with the TFS Action Pack.

 These Actions access Team Foundation Server repositories. Use the Actions to check in/out files, create workspaces, add new files or to merge branches.

###### Actions
 
 1. Add
 2. Branch
 3. Checkin
 4. Checkout
 5. Create Workspace
 6. Delete
 7. Get
 8. Merge
 9. Move
